    "Day 1: Sonar Sweep ---\n",
    "You're minding your own business on a ship at sea when the overboard alarm goes off! You rush to see if you can help. Apparently, one of the Elves tripped and accidentally sent the sleigh keys flying into the ocean!\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you know it, you're inside a submarine the Elves keep ready for situations like this. It's covered in Christmas lights (because of course it is), and it even has an experimental antenna that should be able to track the keys if you can boost its signal strength high enough; there's a little meter that indicates the antenna's signal strength by displaying 0-50 stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your instincts tell you that in order to save Christmas, you'll need to get all fifty stars by December 25th.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!\n",
    "\n",
    "As the submarine drops below the surface of the ocean, it automatically performs a sonar sweep of the nearby sea floor. On a small screen, the sonar sweep report (your puzzle input) appears: each line is a measurement of the sea floor depth as the sweep looks further and further away from the submarine.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose you had the following report:\n",
    "```\n",
    "199\n",
    "200\n",
    "208\n",
    "210\n",
    "200\n",
    "207\n",
    "240\n",
    "269\n",
    "260\n",
    "263\n",
    "```\n",
    "This report indicates that, scanning outward from the submarine, the sonar sweep found depths of 199, 200, 208, 210, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first order of business is to figure out how quickly the depth increases, just so you know what you're dealing with - you never know if the keys will get carried into deeper water by an ocean current or a fish or something.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, count the number of times a depth measurement increases from the previous measurement. (There is no measurement before the first measurement.) In the example above, the changes are as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "199 (N/A - no previous measurement)\n",
    "200 (increased)\n",
    "208 (increased)\n",
    "210 (increased)\n",
    "200 (decreased)\n",
    "207 (increased)\n",
    "240 (increased)\n",
    "269 (increased)\n",
    "260 (decreased)\n",
    "263 (increased)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, there are 7 measurements that are larger than the previous measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "How many measurements are larger than the previous measurement?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part Two\n",
    "Considering every single measurement isn't as useful as you expected: there's just too much noise in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, consider sums of a three-measurement sliding window. Again considering the above example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "199  A      \n",
    "200  A B    \n",
    "208  A B C  \n",
    "210    B C D\n",
    "200  E   C D\n",
    "207  E F   D\n",
    "240  E F G  \n",
    "269    F G H\n",
    "260      G H\n",
    "263        H\n",
    "```\n",
    "Start by comparing the first and second three-measurement windows. The measurements in the first window are marked A `(199, 200, 208)`; their sum is `199 + 200 + 208 = 607`. The second window is marked B (200, 208, 210); its sum is 618. The sum of measurements in the second window is larger than the sum of the first, so this first comparison increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal now is to count the number of times the sum of measurements in this sliding window increases from the previous sum. So, compare A with B, then compare B with C, then C with D, and so on. Stop when there aren't enough measurements left to create a new three-measurement sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, the sum of each three-measurement window is as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "A: 607 (N/A - no previous sum)\n",
    "B: 618 (increased)\n",
    "C: 618 (no change)\n",
    "D: 617 (decreased)\n",
    "E: 647 (increased)\n",
    "F: 716 (increased)\n",
    "G: 769 (increased)\n",
    "H: 792 (increased)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, there are 5 sums that are larger than the previous sum.\n",

    "forward 8\n",
    "up 3\n",
    "down 8\n",

    "\n",
    "- forward 5 adds 5 to your horizontal position, a total of 5.\n",
    "- down 5 adds 5 to your depth, resulting in a value of 5.\n",
    "- forward 8 adds 8 to your horizontal position, a total of 13.\n",
    "- up 3 decreases your depth by 3, resulting in a value of 2.\n",
    "- down 8 adds 8 to your depth, resulting in a value of 10.\n",
    "- forward 2 adds 2 to your horizontal position, a total of 15.\n",
    "\n",
    "After following these instructions, you would have a horizontal position of 15 and a depth of 10. (Multiplying these together produces 150.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the horizontal position and depth you would have after following the planned course. What do you get if you multiply your final horizontal position by your final depth?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part Two\n",
    "Based on your calculations, the planned course doesn't seem to make any sense. You find the submarine manual and discover that the process is actually slightly more complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to horizontal position and depth, you'll also need to track a third value, aim, which also starts at 0. The commands also mean something entirely different than you first thought:\n",
    "\n",
    "- down X increases your aim by X units.\n",
    "- up X decreases your aim by X units.\n",

    "\n",
    "- forward 5 adds 5 to your horizontal position, a total of 5. Because your aim is 0, your depth does not change.\n",
    "- down 5 adds 5 to your aim, resulting in a value of 5.\n",
    "forward 8 adds 8 to your horizontal position, a total of 13. Because your aim is 5, your depth increases by 8*5=40.\n",
    "- up 3 decreases your aim by 3, resulting in a value of 2.\n",
    "- down 8 adds 8 to your aim, resulting in a value of 10.\n",
    "- forward 2 adds 2 to your horizontal position, a total of 15. Because your aim is 10, your depth increases by 2*10=20 to a total of 60.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Day 3: Binary Diagnostic\n",
    "The submarine has been making some odd creaking noises, so you ask it to produce a diagnostic report just in case.\n",

It would be a waste of time to visit any small cave more than once, but big caves are large enough that it might be worth visiting them multiple times. So, all paths you find should visit small caves at most once, and can visit big caves any number of times.\n",

The submarine has polymerization equipment that would produce suitable materials to reinforce the submarine, and the nearby volcanically-active caves should even have the necessary input elements in sufficient quantities.\n",

    "The submarine manual contains instructions for finding the optimal polymer formula; specifically, it offers a polymer template and a list of pair insertion rules (your puzzle input). You just need to work out what polymer would result after repeating the pair insertion process a few times.\n",

    "\n",
    "So, starting with the polymer template NNCB, the first step simultaneously considers all three pairs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first pair (NN) matches the rule NN -> C, so element C is inserted between the first N and the second N.\n",

    "\n",
    "After the first step of this process, the polymer becomes `NCNBCHB`.\n",

It's difficult to navigate in the pitch black open waters of the ocean trench, but if you can build a map of the trench using data from the scanners, you should be able to safely reach the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beacons and scanners float motionless in the water; they're designed to maintain the same position for long periods of time. Each scanner is capable of detecting all beacons in a large cube centered on the scanner; beacons that are at most 1000 units away from the scanner in each of the three axes (x, y, and z) have their precise position determined relative to the scanner. However, scanners cannot detect other scanners. The submarine has automatically summarized the relative positions of beacons detected by each scanner (your puzzle input).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a scanner is at x,y,z coordinates 500,0,-500 and there are beacons at -500,1000,-1500 and 1501,0,-500, the scanner could report that the first beacon is at -1000,1000,-1000 (relative to the scanner) but would not detect the second beacon at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, while each scanner can report the positions of all detected beacons relative to itself, the scanners do not know their own position. You'll need to determine the positions of the beacons and scanners yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scanners and beacons map a single contiguous 3d region. This region can be reconstructed by finding pairs of scanners that have overlapping detection regions such that there are at least 12 beacons that both scanners detect within the overlap. By establishing 12 common beacons, you can precisely determine where the scanners are relative to each other, allowing you to reconstruct the beacon map one scanner at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a moment, consider only two dimensions. Suppose you have the following scanner reports:\n",
    "```\n",
    "--- scanner 0 ---\n",
    "0,2\n",
    "4,1\n",
    "3,3\n",

    "--- scanner 1 ---\n",
    "-1,-1\n",
    "-5,0\n",
    "-2,1\n",
    "```\n",
    "Drawing x increasing rightward, y increasing upward, scanners as S, and beacons as B, scanner 0 detects this:\n",

    "...B.\n",
    "B....\n",
    "....B\n",

    "Scanner 1 detects this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "...B..\n",
    "B....S\n",
    "....B.\n",
    "```\n",
    "For this example, assume scanners only need 3 overlapping beacons. Then, the beacons visible to both scanners overlap to produce the following complete map:\n",
    "```\n",
    "...B..\n",
    "B....S\n",
    "....B.\n",
    "S.....\n",
    "```\n",
    "Unfortunately, there's a second problem: the scanners also don't know their rotation or facing direction. Due to magnetic alignment, each scanner is rotated some integer number of 90-degree turns around all of the x, y, and z axes. That is, one scanner might call a direction positive x, while another scanner might call that direction negative y. Or, two scanners might agree on which direction is positive x, but one scanner might be upside-down from the perspective of the other scanner. In total, each scanner could be in any of 24 different orientations: facing positive or negative x, y, or z, and considering any of four directions \"up\" from that facing.\n",

    "The first section is the image enhancement algorithm. It is normally given on a single line, but it has been wrapped to multiple lines in this example for legibility. The second section is the input image, a two-dimensional grid of light pixels (#) and dark pixels (.).\n",
    "\n",
    "The image enhancement algorithm describes how to enhance an image by simultaneously converting all pixels in the input image into an output image. Each pixel of the output image is determined by looking at a 3x3 square of pixels centered on the corresponding input image pixel. So, to determine the value of the pixel at (5,10) in the output image, nine pixels from the input image need to be considered: (4,9), (4,10), (4,11), (5,9), (5,10), (5,11), (6,9), (6,10), and (6,11). These nine input pixels are combined into a single binary number that is used as an index in the image enhancement algorithm string.\n",

    "\n",
    "The image enhancement algorithm string is exactly 512 characters long, enough to match every possible 9-bit binary number. The first few characters of the string (numbered starting from zero) are as follows:\n",

    "0         10        20        30  34    40        50        60        70\n",

    "..#.#..#####.#.#.#.###.##.....###.##.#..###.####..#####..#....#..#..##..##\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the middle of this first group of characters, the character at index 34 can be found: #. So, the output pixel in the center of the output image should be #, a light pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process can then be repeated to calculate every pixel of the output image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through advances in imaging technology, the images being operated on here are infinite in size. Every pixel of the infinite output image needs to be calculated exactly based on the relevant pixels of the input image. The small input image you have is only a small region of the actual infinite input image; the rest of the input image consists of dark pixels (.). For the purposes of the example, to save on space, only a portion of the infinite-sized input and output images will be shown.\n",

    "\n",
    "There's not much to do as you slowly descend to the bottom of the ocean. The submarine computer challenges you to a nice game of Dirac Dice.\n",
    "\n",
    "This game consists of a single die, two pawns, and a game board with a circular track containing ten spaces marked 1 through 10 clockwise. Each player's starting space is chosen randomly (your puzzle input). Player 1 goes first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Players take turns moving. On each player's turn, the player rolls the die three times and adds up the results. Then, the player moves their pawn that many times forward around the track (that is, moving clockwise on spaces in order of increasing value, wrapping back around to 1 after 10). So, if a player is on space 7 and they roll 2, 2, and 1, they would move forward 5 times, to spaces 8, 9, 10, 1, and finally stopping on 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "After each player moves, they increase their score by the value of the space their pawn stopped on. Players' scores start at 0. So, if the first player starts on space 7 and rolls a total of 5, they would stop on space 2 and add 2 to their score (for a total score of 2). The game immediately ends as a win for any player whose score reaches at least 1000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the first game is a practice game, the submarine opens a compartment labeled deterministic dice and a 100-sided die falls out. This die always rolls 1 first, then 2, then 3, and so on up to 100, after which it starts over at 1 again. Play using this die.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given these starting positions:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Player 1 starting position: 4\n",
    "Player 2 starting position: 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is how the game would go:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Player 1 rolls 1+2+3 and moves to space 10 for a total score of 10.\n",
    "Player 2 rolls 4+5+6 and moves to space 3 for a total score of 3.\n",
    "Player 1 rolls 7+8+9 and moves to space 4 for a total score of 14.\n",
    "Player 2 rolls 10+11+12 and moves to space 6 for a total score of 9.\n",
    "Player 1 rolls 13+14+15 and moves to space 6 for a total score of 20.\n",
    "Player 2 rolls 16+17+18 and moves to space 7 for a total score of 16.\n",
    "Player 1 rolls 19+20+21 and moves to space 6 for a total score of 26.\n",
    "Player 2 rolls 22+23+24 and moves to space 6 for a total score of 22.\n",
    "...after many turns...\n",
    "\n",
    "Player 2 rolls 82+83+84 and moves to space 6 for a total score of 742.\n",
    "Player 1 rolls 85+86+87 and moves to space 4 for a total score of 990.\n",
    "Player 2 rolls 88+89+90 and moves to space 3 for a total score of 745.\n",
    "Player 1 rolls 91+92+93 and moves to space 10 for a final score, 1000.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Since player 1 has at least 1000 points, player 1 wins and the game ends. At this point, the losing player had 745 points and the die had been rolled a total of 993 times; 745 * 993 = 739785.\n",
    "\n",
    "Play a practice game using the deterministic 100-sided die. The moment either player wins, what do you get if you multiply the score of the losing player by the number of times the die was rolled during the game?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part Two\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you're warmed up, it's time to play the real game.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second compartment opens, this time labeled Dirac dice. Out of it falls a single three-sided die.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you experiment with the die, you feel a little strange. An informational brochure in the compartment explains that this is a quantum die: when you roll it, the universe splits into multiple copies, one copy for each possible outcome of the die. In this case, rolling the die always splits the universe into three copies: one where the outcome of the roll was 1, one where it was 2, and one where it was 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game is played the same as before, although to prevent things from getting too far out of hand, the game now ends when either player's score reaches at least 21.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the same starting positions as in the example above, player 1 wins in 444356092776315 universes, while player 2 merely wins in 341960390180808 universes.\n",
    "\n",

    "They give you a diagram of the situation (your puzzle input), including locations of each amphipod (A, B, C, or D, each of which is occupying an otherwise open space), walls (#), and open space (.).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "#############\n",
    "#...........#\n",

    "  #A#D#C#A#\n",
    "  #########\n",
    "```\n",
    "The amphipods would like a method to organize every amphipod into side rooms so that each side room contains one type of amphipod and the types are sorted A-D going left to right, like this:\n",

    "Amphipods can move up, down, left, or right so long as they are moving into an unoccupied open space. Each type of amphipod requires a different amount of energy to move one step: Amber amphipods require 1 energy per step, Bronze amphipods require 10 energy, Copper amphipods require 100, and Desert ones require 1000. The amphipods would like you to find a way to organize the amphipods that requires the least total energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, because they are timid and stubborn, the amphipods have some extra rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Amphipods will never stop on the space immediately outside any room. They can move into that space so long as they immediately continue moving. (Specifically, this refers to the four open spaces in the hallway that are directly above an amphipod starting position.)\n",
    "- Amphipods will never move from the hallway into a room unless that room is their destination room and that room contains no amphipods which do not also have that room as their own destination. If an amphipod's starting room is not its destination room, it can stay in that room until it leaves the room. (For example, an Amber amphipod will not move from the hallway into the right three rooms, and will only move into the leftmost room if that room is empty or if it only contains other Amber amphipods.)\n",
    "- Once an amphipod stops moving in the hallway, it will stay in that spot until it can move into a room. (That is, once any amphipod starts moving, any other amphipods currently in the hallway are locked in place and will not move again until they can move fully into a room.)\n",

    "\n",
    "Don't worry, though - you probably have enough oxygen left to give you enough time to build a new ALU.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ALU is a four-dimensional processing unit: it has integer variables w, x, y, and z. These variables all start with the value 0. The ALU also supports six instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- inp a - Read an input value and write it to variable a.\n",
    "- add a b - Add the value of a to the value of b, then store the result in variable a.\n",
    "- mul a b - Multiply the value of a by the value of b, then store the result in variable a.\n",
    "- div a b - Divide the value of a by the value of b, truncate the result to an integer, then store the result in variable a. (Here, \"truncate\" means to round the value toward zero.)\n",
    "- mod a b - Divide the value of a by the value of b, then store the remainder in variable a. (This is also called the modulo operation.)\n",
    "- eql a b - If the value of a and b are equal, then store the value 1 in variable a. Otherwise, store the value 0 in variable a.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all of these instructions, a and b are placeholders; a will always be the variable where the result of the operation is stored (one of w, x, y, or z), while b can be either a variable or a number. Numbers can be positive or negative, but will always be integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ALU has no jump instructions; in an ALU program, every instruction is run exactly once in order from top to bottom. The program halts after the last instruction has finished executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Program authors should be especially cautious; attempting to execute div with b=0 or attempting to execute mod with a<0 or b<=0 will cause the program to crash and might even damage the ALU. These operations are never intended in any serious ALU program.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here is an ALU program which takes an input number, negates it, and stores it in x:\n",
    "```\n",
    "inp x\n",
    "mul x -1\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here is an ALU program which takes two input numbers, then sets z to 1 if the second input number is three times larger than the first input number, or sets z to 0 otherwise:\n",
    "```\n",
    "inp z\n",
    "inp x\n",
    "mul z 3\n",
    "eql z x\n",

    "Once you have built a replacement ALU, you can install it in the submarine, which will immediately resume what it was doing when the ALU failed: validating the submarine's model number. To do this, the ALU will run the MOdel Number Automatic Detector program (MONAD, your puzzle input).\n",
    "\n",
    "Submarine model numbers are always fourteen-digit numbers consisting only of digits 1 through 9. The digit 0 cannot appear in a model number.\n",
    "\n",
    "When MONAD checks a hypothetical fourteen-digit model number, it uses fourteen separate inp instructions, each expecting a single digit of the model number in order of most to least significant. (So, to check the model number 13579246899999, you would give 1 to the first inp instruction, 3 to the second inp instruction, 5 to the third inp instruction, and so on.) This means that when operating MONAD, each input instruction should only ever be given an integer value of at least 1 and at most 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, after MONAD has finished running all of its instructions, it will indicate that the model number was valid by leaving a 0 in variable z. However, if the model number was invalid, it will leave some other non-zero value in z.\n",
    "\n",

    "This is it: the bottom of the ocean trench, the last place the sleigh keys could be. Your submarine's experimental antenna still isn't boosted enough to detect the keys, but they must be here. All you need to do is reach the seafloor and find them.\n",

    "\"Sea cucumbers? Yeah, they're probably hunting for food. But don't worry, they're predictable critters: they move in perfectly straight lines, only moving forward when there's space to do so. They're actually quite polite!\"\n",

    "There are two herds of sea cucumbers sharing the same region; one always moves east (>), while the other always moves south (v).
