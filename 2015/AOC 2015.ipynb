    "This year, Santa brought little Bobby Tables a set of wires and bitwise logic gates! Unfortunately, little Bobby is a little under the recommended age range, and he needs help assembling the circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each wire has an identifier (some lowercase letters) and can carry a 16-bit signal (a number from 0 to 65535). A signal is provided to each wire by a gate, another wire, or some specific value. Each wire can only get a signal from one source, but can provide its signal to multiple destinations. A gate provides no signal until all of its inputs have a signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The included instructions booklet describes how to connect the parts together: `x AND y -> z` means to connect wires `x` and `y` to an `AND` gate, and then connect its output to wire `z`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`123 -> x` means that the signal 123 is provided to wire `x`.\n",
    "`x AND y -> z` means that the bitwise AND of wire `x` and wire `y` is provided to wire `z`.\n",
    "`p LSHIFT 2 -> q` means that the value from wire `p` is left-shifted by `2` and then provided to wire `q`.\n",
    "`NOT e -> f` means that the bitwise complement of the value from wire `e` is provided to wire `f`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other possible gates include `OR` (bitwise OR) and `RSHIFT` (right-shift). If, for some reason, you'd like to emulate the circuit instead, almost all programming languages (for example, C, JavaScript, or Python) provide operators for these gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here is a simple circuit:\n",
    "```\n",
    "123 -> x\n",
    "456 -> y\n",
    "x AND y -> d\n",
    "x OR y -> e\n",

    "y RSHIFT 2 -> g\n",
    "NOT x -> h\n",
    "NOT y -> i\n",

    "It is common in many programming languages to provide a way to escape special characters in strings. For example, C, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and even PHP handle special characters in very similar ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is important to realize the difference between the number of characters in the code representation of the string literal and the number of characters in the in-memory string itself.\n",

    "\n",
    "* `\"\"` is 2 characters of code (the two double quotes), but the string contains zero characters.\n",
    "* `\"abc\"` is 5 characters of code, but 3 characters in the string data.\n",
    "* `\"aaa\\\"aaa\"` is 10 characters of code, but the string itself contains six \"a\" characters and a single, escaped quote character, for a total of 7 characters in the string data.\n",
    "* `\"\\x27\"` is 6 characters of code, but the string itself contains just one - an apostrophe ('), escaped using hexadecimal notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Santa's list is a file that contains many double-quoted string literals, one on each line. The only escape sequences used are \\\\ (which represents a single backslash), \\\" (which represents a lone double-quote character), and \\x plus two hexadecimal characters (which represents a single character with that ASCII code).\n",
    "\n",
    "Disregarding the whitespace in the file, what is the number of characters of code for string literals minus the number of characters in memory for the values of the strings in total for the entire file?\n",

    "For example, given the four strings above, the total number of characters of string code (2 + 5 + 10 + 6 = 23) minus the total number of characters in memory for string values (0 + 3 + 7 + 1 = 11) is 23 - 11 = 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part Two\n",
    "Now, let's go the other way. In addition to finding the number of characters of code, you should now encode each code representation as a new string and find the number of characters of the new encoded representation, including the surrounding double quotes.\n",

    "\"\\x27\" encodes to \"\\\"\\\\x27\\\"\", an increase from 6 characters to 11.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to find the total number of characters to represent the newly encoded strings minus the number of characters of code in each original string literal. For example, for the strings above, the total encoded length (6 + 9 + 16 + 11 = 42) minus the characters in the original code representation (23, just like in the first part of this puzzle) is 42 - 23 = 19."

    "Red-Nosed Reindeer biology isn't similar to regular reindeer biology; Rudolph is going to need custom-made medicine. Unfortunately, Red-Nosed Reindeer chemistry isn't similar to regular reindeer chemistry, either.\n",
    "\n",
    "The North Pole is equipped with a Red-Nosed Reindeer nuclear fusion/fission plant, capable of constructing any Red-Nosed Reindeer molecule you need. It works by starting with some input molecule and then doing a series of replacements, one per step, until it has the right molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the machine has to be calibrated before it can be used. Calibration involves determining the number of molecules that can be generated in one step from a given starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine a simpler machine that supports only the following replacements:\n",
    "```\n",
    "H => HO\n",
    "H => OH\n",
    "O => HH\n",

    "So, in the example above, there are 4 distinct molecules (not five, because HOOH appears twice) after one replacement from HOH. Santa's favorite molecule, HOHOHO, can become 7 distinct molecules (over nine replacements: six from H, and three from O).\n",
    "\n",
    "The machine replaces without regard for the surrounding characters. For example, given the string H2O, the transition H => OO would result in OO2O.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your puzzle input describes all of the possible replacements and, at the bottom, the medicine molecule for which you need to calibrate the machine. How many distinct molecules can be created after all the different ways you can do one replacement on the medicine molecule?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part Two\n",
    "Now that the machine is calibrated, you're ready to begin molecule fabrication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Molecule fabrication always begins with just a single electron, e, and applying replacements one at a time, just like the ones during calibration.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose you have the following replacements:\n",
    "```\n",
    "e => H\n",
    "e => O\n",
    "H => HO\n",
    "H => OH\n",
    "O => HH\n",

    "e => O to get O\n",
    "O => HH to get HH\n",
    "H => OH (on the second H) to get HOH\n",

    "# Day 24: It Hangs in the Balance\n",
    "It's Christmas Eve, and Santa is loading up the sleigh for this year's deliveries. However, there's one small problem: he can't get the sleigh to balance. If it isn't balanced, he can't defy physics, and nobody gets presents this year.\n",
    "\n",
    "No pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Santa has provided you a list of the weights of every package he needs to fit on the sleigh. The packages need to be split into three groups of exactly the same weight, and every package has to fit. The first group goes in the passenger compartment of the sleigh, and the second and third go in containers on either side. Only when all three groups weigh exactly the same amount will the sleigh be able to fly. Defying physics has rules, you know!\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, that's not the only problem. The first group - the one going in the passenger compartment - needs as few packages as possible so that Santa has some legroom left over. It doesn't matter how many packages are in either of the other two groups, so long as all of the groups weigh the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, Santa tells you, if there are multiple ways to arrange the packages such that the fewest possible are in the first group, you need to choose the way where the first group has the smallest quantum entanglement to reduce the chance of any \"complications\". The quantum entanglement of a group of packages is the product of their weights, that is, the value you get when you multiply their weights together. Only consider quantum entanglement if the first group has the fewest possible number of packages in it and all groups weigh the same amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose you have ten packages with weights 1 through 5 and 7 through 11. For this situation, some of the unique first groups, their quantum entanglements, and a way to divide the remaining packages are as follows:\n",
    "```\n",

    "9 7 4      (QE=252); 11 8 1;  10 5 3 2\n",
    "9 5 4 2    (QE=360); 11 8 1;  10 7 3\n",

    "7 5 4 3 1  (QE=420); 11 9;    10 8 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "Of these, although 10 9 1 has the smallest quantum entanglement (90), the configuration with only two packages, 11 9, in the passenger compartment gives Santa the most legroom and wins. In this situation, the quantum entanglement for the ideal configuration is therefore 99. Had there been two configurations with only two packages in the first group, the one with the smaller quantum entanglement would be chosen.\n",
