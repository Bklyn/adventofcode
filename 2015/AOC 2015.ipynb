    "\n",
    "This year, Santa brought little Bobby Tables a set of wires and bitwise logic gates! Unfortunately, little Bobby is a little under the recommended age range, and he needs help assembling the circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each wire has an identifier (some lowercase letters) and can carry a 16-bit signal (a number from 0 to 65535). A signal is provided to each wire by a gate, another wire, or some specific value. Each wire can only get a signal from one source, but can provide its signal to multiple destinations. A gate provides no signal until all of its inputs have a signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The included instructions booklet describes how to connect the parts together: `x AND y -> z` means to connect wires `x` and `y` to an `AND` gate, and then connect its output to wire `z`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`123 -> x` means that the signal 123 is provided to wire `x`.\n",
    "`x AND y -> z` means that the bitwise AND of wire `x` and wire `y` is provided to wire `z`.\n",
    "`p LSHIFT 2 -> q` means that the value from wire `p` is left-shifted by `2` and then provided to wire `q`.\n",
    "`NOT e -> f` means that the bitwise complement of the value from wire `e` is provided to wire `f`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other possible gates include `OR` (bitwise OR) and `RSHIFT` (right-shift). If, for some reason, you'd like to emulate the circuit instead, almost all programming languages (for example, C, JavaScript, or Python) provide operators for these gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here is a simple circuit:\n",
    "```\n",
    "123 -> x\n",
    "456 -> y\n",
    "x AND y -> d\n",
    "x OR y -> e\n",
    "x LSHIFT 2 -> f\n",
    "y RSHIFT 2 -> g\n",
    "NOT x -> h\n",

    "f: 492\n",

    "It is common in many programming languages to provide a way to escape special characters in strings. For example, C, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and even PHP handle special characters in very similar ways.\n",
    "\n",

    "* `\"\"` is 2 characters of code (the two double quotes), but the string contains zero characters.\n",
    "* `\"abc\"` is 5 characters of code, but 3 characters in the string data.\n",

    "* `\"\\x27\"` is 6 characters of code, but the string itself contains just one - an apostrophe ('), escaped using hexadecimal notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Santa's list is a file that contains many double-quoted string literals, one on each line. The only escape sequences used are \\\\ (which represents a single backslash), \\\" (which represents a lone double-quote character), and \\x plus two hexadecimal characters (which represents a single character with that ASCII code).\n",
    "\n",
    "Disregarding the whitespace in the file, what is the number of characters of code for string literals minus the number of characters in memory for the values of the strings in total for the entire file?\n",

    "## Part Two\n",

    "\"\\x27\" encodes to \"\\\"\\\\x27\\\"\", an increase from 6 characters to 11.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to find the total number of characters to represent the newly encoded strings minus the number of characters of code in each original string literal. For example, for the strings above, the total encoded length (6 + 9 + 16 + 11 = 42) minus the characters in the original code representation (23, just like in the first part of this puzzle) is 42 - 23 = 19."
